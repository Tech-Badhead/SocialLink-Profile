### The challenge

Users should be able to:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I learnt about the positioning of elements on the webpage and i must admit working with the width and max-width property was much fun compare to previous challanges which was just a pain in the neck.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: block;
}
```
